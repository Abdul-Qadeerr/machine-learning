##  Notebooks

Each notebook focuses on a specific algorithm with **theory + implementation**:

1. Linear Regression  
2. Logistic Regression  
3. Decision Trees  
4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
5. Naive Bayes  
6. Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
7. K-Means Clustering  
8. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
9. Model Evaluation  

 Open in **Google Colab** or Jupyter to run interactively.
