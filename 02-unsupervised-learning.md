# Unsupervised Learning

## Definition
Unsupervised learning is when the model is trained using **unlabeled data** (no outputs provided).  
The algorithm tries to find hidden **patterns, structures, or relationships** in the data.

## Types
1. **Clustering** – grouping similar data points.  
   - Example: Customer segmentation in marketing.  
2. **Dimensionality Reduction** – reducing the number of features while keeping important information.  
   - Example: Compressing image files.

## Steps
1. Provide only input data (no labels).  
2. Model organizes the data based on similarity or structure.

## Real-life Examples
- **Retail:** Grouping customers based on buying behavior (high spenders vs casual buyers).  
- **Streaming Services (Netflix/Spotify):** Suggesting movies or songs based on hidden viewing/listening patterns.  
- **Biology:** Grouping similar genetic sequences to study evolution.
